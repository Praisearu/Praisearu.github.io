     <main class="a">
                <p> <b>M</b>y name is Praise Aruwajoye, and I am a junior studying Information Technology with a minor in Mathematics. Born in Saint Louis and shaped by my Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, I bring a unique perspective and a global mindset to every endeavor. My love for mathematics drives my approach to problem-solving and fuels my creativity in programming. For the past three years, I majored in Computer Science, where I developed a strong foundation in software development, data structures, and algorithms. Recently, I made the intentional decision to switch to Information Technology—a path that aligns more closely with my interest in hands-on, people-centered tech solutions.
        
                </p>
        
                <p>Like many students, I began college unsure of what I wanted to pursue. I had no background in coding or engineering, but when I took my first programming course, something clicked. Learning how to code from scratch felt like solving a puzzle—challenging and sometimes frustrating, but incredibly rewarding when everything came together. That discovery helped me realize not just what I was capable of, but what I genuinely enjoyed. Choosing to transition to IT wasn’t about walking away from Computer Science; it was about stepping into a space where I could combine technical knowledge with practical application and user-centered design.
       
                </p>
        
         <p>The road hasn’t always been easy. There were times I doubted myself, questioned whether I was prepared enough, or worried that I didn’t belong in tech at all. But every late night, failed attempt, and moment of uncertainty has shaped who I am today. Through it all, I’ve gained resilience, confidence, and a clearer vision for my future. Changing majors wasn’t just a shift in academic focus—it was an act of courage and self-belief. It was about starting over and proving to myself that growth often comes from taking risks.
        
                </p>
        
                <p>As I enter my senior year, I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited for where I’m headed. I’m passionate about technology not only because of its ever-evolving nature, but also because of the creativity and problem-solving it demands. I’m especially driven to create space for others—particularly students from underrepresented communities—to see themselves in tech. I know what it feels like to start from zero and feel unsure, and I want my journey to serve as proof that you don’t have to have it all figured out from day one. With curiosity, grit, and a willingness to begin, anything is possible—and I’m just getting started.</p>
