            <h2>Olokunbobade Management System (Java + SQL)</h2>
            <p>The Olokunbobade Management System is an application designed to streamline
                the organization and management of data for my family’s annual reunion. This
                project reflects my commitment to solving real-world challenges while honoring
                the connections that matter most. The system offers a range of features tailored
                to enhance efficiency and accessibility. Users can add new family members,
                retrieve birthdays, display family groups under the Olokunbobade umbrella,
                manage T-shirt orders and sizes, confirm attendance, and track reunion dues,
                including payment statuses. In addition, the system is designed to provide a more
                personal touch by integrating with WhatsApp. For example, when viewing a
                family member's birthday, the system can prompt the user with the option to
                send a birthday message. If the user chooses to proceed, it will seamlessly
                redirect them to WhatsApp, ready to send a personalized message. This feature
                not only fosters stronger connections within the family but also adds
                convenience by leveraging widely used communication tools. These features
                address common pain points in event coordination and ensures a smooth
                experience for all users. Recognizing the diverse technical abilities within my
                family, I prioritized creating a user-friendly interface that accommodates
                everyone, including older relatives who may have less experience with
                technology. The design emphasizes simplicity and intuitive navigation, making
                the system accessible to all users. This project was developed using SQL and Java,
                ensuring data management and real-time updates. Any new information entered
                by users is immediately reflected in the database, promong accuracy, and
                reducing manual effort. This application not only demonstrates my technical skills
                but also highlights my ability to create meaningful, impacful solutions tailored to
                specific needs. The Management System reflects my dedication to using
                technology to bring people together and strengthen connections.</p></div>

            <h2>Brunswick Emergency Beacon (UX/UI + Emergency Preparedness App)</h2>
            <p>The Brunswick Emergency Beacon (BEB) is a community-centered application developed to improve emergency preparedness and communication in Brunswick, Missouri—a town historically impacted by natural disasters like river flooding, fires, and tornadoes. This project was born out of a real-world need for accessible and timely emergency alerts in rural areas where communication infrastructure is often limited.

                The app is designed to provide residents with critical safety updates and resources during crises. It features clear tab-based navigation for different disaster types, including floods, fires, and tornadoes. Each section offers preparation graphics, evacuation routes, designated shelter locations, and step-by-step safety guidelines. In addition, the app includes a contact list for local emergency services, making vital support easily reachable when seconds count.
                
                This project reflects our team’s commitment to human-centered design and collaborative problem-solving. We worked closely with town leadership, emergency responders, and community stakeholders to identify the most urgent needs and tailor the app accordingly. Our user experience emphasized clarity, simplicity, and fast access to life-saving information.
                
                The Brunswick Emergency Beacon not only showcases my contributions as a UX/UI designer but also highlights my ability to apply technology for social good. From research to prototyping and design, this project demonstrates how thoughtful design can empower communities and foster resilience in the face of natural disasters.</p></div>

            <h2>Personal Portfolio Website (HTML + CSS)</h2>
            <p>My personal portfolio website is a custom-built project that showcases my skills, experience, and creative work as a developer and designer. Built entirely with HTML and CSS, the site reflects both my technical proficiency and my attention to visual design, responsiveness, and usability.

                The site features a clean, structured layout with intuitive navigation, making it easy for visitors to explore my background, personal projects, resume, and contact information. I focused on ensuring a consistent and professional aesthetic across both desktop and mobile views using semantic HTML and responsive design techniques.
                
                Beyond just serving as an online resume, this project demonstrates my ability to design, code, and maintain a functional, user-centered website from the ground up. Every section is purposefully crafted to communicate not just what I’ve done, but how I approach problem-solving, creativity, and presentation.
                
                This project stands as a reflection of my personal brand and technical identity, showing how I use code and design to tell my story in a meaningful and professional way.
