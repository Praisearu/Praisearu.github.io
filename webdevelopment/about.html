    <h2>Praise Aruwajoye</h2>

    <p>
        I graduated from Hazelwood East High School in St. Louis, Missouri, and I am currently a junior at the University of Missouri â€“ Columbia, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Information Technology and Mathematics. I am on track to graduate in Spring 2026. <br><br> So far, I have experience in Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, C, C++, Python, and Swift, but I am always eager to expand my skill set.
    </p>

    <p>One of my favorite quotes is,</p>
    
    <blockquote> <p>
         <em> You have to be uncomfortable in order to grow.</em></p> 
        <p><strong> -Unknown </strong> </p> 
    </blockquote>

     <p> I continuously apply this mindset to my personal and professional growth, constantly pushing myself beyond my comfort zone. I believe that growth comes from challenges, which is why I actively seek new learning opportunities and experiences. </p>
