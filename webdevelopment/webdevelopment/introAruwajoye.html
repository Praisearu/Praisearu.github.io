<title>Welcome to Praise's Website</title>

    My name is Praise Aruwajoye. I am a junior majoring in Computer Science. I am also minoring in Information Technology and Mathematics. I donâ€™t have any real experience with web development, but I have watched a couple introductory videos on HTML. I am hoping to gain web design experience/skills that I can use in my career. I would also like to have the opportunity to make a portfolio website that showcases all the projects that I have worked on.  I love traveling and reading. But I mostly like spending time with my family and friends.
